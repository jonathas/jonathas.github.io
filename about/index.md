Hey there! I'm Jonathas Ribeiro (but you can call me Jon). I was born in Rio de Janeiro but have been living in the Czech Republic since 2015.

I've been working as a Software Developer since 2008 and have experience with a variety of technologies such as PHP, .NET, Ionic Framework, Angular, Java/Spring, React, and Node.js. My journey with programming began as a teenager when I would hack HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build websites.

Throughout my career, I have worked on several software projects in various industries including fitness, video streaming and TV apps, VoIP, e-commerce, fashion, and finances. My work has been used by people in countries such as the USA, Brazil, and throughout Europe.

I have been using Linux since 2006 and have a special love for Arch Linux and Debian. In my free time, you'll find me taking photos, playing videogames, watching series, going to the gym for boxing and weightlifting or traveling.

Thanks for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring the content here!
