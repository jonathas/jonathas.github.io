Hi, I'm Jonathas Ribeiro (a.k.a. Jon). I was born in Rio de Janeiro, but I'm currently living in Prague, Czech Republic.

I started working as a Software Developer in 2008, and since then have always been improving my knowledge while achieving my goals and the goals of the companies I work for.

I've been using GNU/Linux since December 2006 and I just love and feel at home with my [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) on my Notebook and [Debian GNU/Linux](http://debian.org) on the servers I manage.

As for my hobbies, I like to take photos, really love traveling and strongly agree that it indeed broadens one's mind.

## Professional

I currently work as a Tech Lead and Senior Software Engineer for [CloudTalk](https://www.cloudtalk.io/) remotely from Prague, Czech Republic.
