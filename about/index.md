Hi, I'm Jonathas Rodrigues Ribeiro (a.k.a. Jon). I was born in Rio de Janeiro, but I'm currently living in Brno, Czech Republic.

I've been working as a Software Developer since 2008 and I intend to continue getting better in that area, always improving my knowledge while achieving my goals and the goals of the companies I work for.

I've been using GNU/Linux since December 2006 and I just love and feel at home with my [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) on my Notebook and [Debian GNU/Linux](http://debian.org) on the servers I manage at work and at home.

As for my hobbies, I like to take photos, really love traveling and strongly agree that it indeed broadens one's mind.

In my free time, I enjoy practicing sports such as Muay Thai (Thai Boxing) and working out.

## Professional

I currently work as a Software Engineer for [24/i](http://24i.com) in Brno, Czech Republic.

* [Projects](http://jonathas.com/projects) I've developed or am currently working on.

* [My curriculum](http://jonathas.com/curriculum-vitae) and some other resources about my career
