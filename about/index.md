Hi, I'm Jonathas Rodrigues Ribeiro (a.k.a. Jon). I was born and am currently living in Rio de Janeiro, RJ - Brazil.

I've been working as a Software Developer since 2008 and I intend to continue getting better in that area, probably someday working as a Software Engineer or Project Manager.

I've been using GNU/Linux since December 2006 and I just love and feel at home with my [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) on my Notebook and [Debian GNU/Linux](http://debian.org) on the servers I manage at work and at home.

As for my hobbies, I believe I'll be an eternal languages student. I think it's very important to know other languages and that already brought me many opportunities. Besides English I also know Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese (native) and very basic French. I also really love traveling, and strongly agree that traveling really broadens one's mind.

In my free time, I enjoy practicing sports such as Muay Thai (Thai Boxing), cycling and working out.

## Professional

I currently work as a Software Developer for [Micro University](http://microuniversity.com.br), a company that develops fitness software, with clients all over Brazil. I've been developing for the SaaS (System as a service) model, using PHP with [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com) and MySQL, and a lot of JavaScript (jQuery). I've been doing Linux server management, systems integration (REST/SOAP) and migrating the company's systems to Amazon Web Services (EC2) with Debian GNU/Linux and LAMP, and distributed MySQL databases on Amazon RDS. Currently I've also been developing desktop and web applications using the .NET framework, as well as mobile applications using Ionic Framework/AngularJS/Cordova.
