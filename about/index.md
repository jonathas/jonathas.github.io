Hey there! I'm Jonathas Ribeiro (but you can call me Jon). I was born in Rio de Janeiro but have been living in the Czech Republic since 2015.

I've been working as a Software Developer since 2008 and have experience with a variety of technologies such as PHP, .NET, Ionic Framework, Angular, Java/Spring, React, and Node.js. My journey with programming began as a teenager when I would hack HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build websites.

Throughout my career, I have worked on several software projects for (mostly) startups in industries like fitness, video streaming and TV apps, VoIP, e-commerce, fashion, and finance. My work has been used by people in countries such as the USA, Brazil, and throughout Europe.

Beyond my professional work, I’m passionate about self-hosting and home automation. I run several services on a Raspberry Pi and Home Assistant on a Home Assistant Yellow device, integrated with several devices to create a smarter, more efficient home.

I’ve been using Linux since 2006 and have a special love for Arch Linux and Debian. In my free time, you’ll find me tinkering with home automation, taking photos, playing video games, watching series, lifting heavy stuffa at the gym, or traveling.

Thanks for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring the content here!
