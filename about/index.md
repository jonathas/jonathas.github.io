Hi, I'm Jonathas Rodrigues Ribeiro (a.k.a. Jon). I was born in Rio de Janeiro, but I'm currently living in Brno, Czech Republic.

I started working as a Software Developer in 2008, and since then have always been improving my knowledge while achieving my goals and the goals of the companies I work for.

I've been using GNU/Linux since December 2006 and I just love and feel at home with my [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) on my Notebook and [Debian GNU/Linux](http://debian.org) on the servers I manage at work and at home.

As for my hobbies, I like to take photos, really love traveling and strongly agree that it indeed broadens one's mind.

## Professional

I currently work for [24i](http://24i.com) in Brno, Czech Republic.

* For projects I've developed or am currently working on, please check my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathasribeiro/).
