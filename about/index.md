Hi, I'm Jonathas Rodrigues Ribeiro (a.k.a. Jon). I was born in Rio de Janeiro, but I'm currently living in Brno, Czech Republic.

I've been working as a Software Developer since 2008 and I intend to continue getting better in that area, always improving my knowledge while achieving my goals and the goals of the companies I work for.

I've been using GNU/Linux since December 2006 and I just love and feel at home with my [Arch Linux](http://archlinux.org) on my Notebook and [Debian GNU/Linux](http://debian.org) on the servers I manage at work and at home.

As for my hobbies, I believe I'll be an eternal languages student. I think it's very important to know other languages and that already brought me many opportunities. Besides English I also know Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese (native) and very basic French. I also really love traveling, and strongly agree that traveling really broadens one's mind.

In my free time, I enjoy practicing sports such as Muay Thai (Thai Boxing), cycling and working out.

## Professional

I currently work as a Software Developer for [Mautilus](http://mautilus.com) in Brno, Czech Republic.
