Aulas Coletivas (Group classes)
-------------------------------

These mobile apps and web system were developed for the gyms to control their schedules and see which clients were present and the qualifications for each trainer. 

There's a mobile app for the gym clients, so they can book their activities and qualify them when they are over, and there's a mobile app for the trainers, where they can see who's booked at a certain activity, include more people, mark them as present and take photos in order to prove the presences they marked for that activity. 

The two mobile apps were developed by me using the **Ionic Framework**, so they can be converted into Android, iPhone or Windows Phone apps. The Ionic Framework uses **HTML5**, **CSS**, **AngularJS** and **Cordova**. Both apps have QRCode Reader and camera integration. 

I've also developed an API in **.NET** and hosted it on **Amazon EC2**, which connects to **MySQL** databases on **Amazon RDS**, for the mobile apps to consume and fetch the data from. There's also a web system developed in **ASP.NET**, which I haven't developed all by myself, but participated with my team. 

This web system enables the gym to control the activities, schedules, trainers and clients, as well as see reports about everything related to the mobile apps. I've developed an API in .NET to receive images, resize them and store them on **Amazon S3** for the web system and mobile apps to use for uploading activity and profile pictures. I've integrated both mobile apps with an API I've developed in .NET to manage and display some ads (using Amazon EC2, RDS and S3), as well as gather information about their views, clicks, etc.<br /><br />
