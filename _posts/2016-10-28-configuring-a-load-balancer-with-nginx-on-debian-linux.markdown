During the last 3 months (up to the date of this post), I've been developing a system using Node.js and the company needed a load balancer in order to deploy it.

I decided to record my first tutorial video and this was the theme I chose for it, as implementing this was very interesting for me and I hope it can be useful for more people.

I have some ideas for the next videos, which I intend to record soon, so stay tuned ;)
